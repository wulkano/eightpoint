  - Initial resets of mostly all elements

  Note: Not all of the elements listed here might not contain the properties listed by default but it's entirely possible for someone to add their own stylesheet to be used on every site so it's a good idea to reset all elements just incase so your pages look exactly how you intended them to be.
